# unit
# 
Unit library is used to deal with units of different type.  It is vastly
inspired by the work of Howard E. Hinnant on the std::chrono library and its ambition is to take advantage of the functionalities offered by chrono and extend them to several other units of different systems.

Unit also makes it possible to manage conversions between units of the same system but also of different systems.

The main objective of the Unit library is to work with concrete types when manipulating positions, lengths, velocities and accelerations, in order to avoid programming errors and to detect erroneous manipulations at compile time.
